"I feel the need... the need for speed." 

This Top Gun quote calls to me. I love moving fast. I'm a nerd about planes and space travel. I drive with a bit of a lead foot. I get energy being around high-speed environments and people. 

**Speed concentrates and simplifies.**

When you are moving fast, small changes can have big consequences. A few degrees wrong on a steering wheel at speed can cause a very bad day. 

Speed demands focus. Speed drags you into a flow state. Great ideas and execution happen at speed. When the world rushes by the details blur until only the important remains. Turn here - avoid this hazard - pass this obstacle. 

Speed means playing offense rather than defense. Our brains seek to avoid risk and protect from loss. But you must take shots on goal to win. Fast play opens possibilities on the field of life. An extra outreach or quick push to over-deliver can make an outsized impact. 

"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." Old stoic quotes are cliche in 2021 because they're true. Preparation means being able to go fast. It means being ready to pounce on opportunities when they pop up. Lucky people move fast. 

Cultivate a speed habit. Do small things fast. Don't sweat the details. In most of life and work, done is better than perfect. Build your capacity for more big wins. 

Go fast.

Have fun.

Get lucky.
