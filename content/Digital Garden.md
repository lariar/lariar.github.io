A digital garden is an evolving online space that blends the characteristics of a personal notebook and a wiki. It serves as a platform for individuals to cultivate and share their thoughts, ideas, and knowledge over time, rather than presenting polished, time-stamped articles typical of traditional blogs.

## Key Characteristics of Digital Gardens

- **Continuous Growth**: Unlike conventional blogs, which often present finalized content, digital gardens are never truly "finished." They evolve as the gardener learns and grows, allowing for continuous editing and refinement of notes[1][2][4].

- **Non-linear Organization**: Content in digital gardens is organized by themes or topics rather than chronologically. This structure encourages exploration and connections between ideas, resembling a web of knowledge rather than a linear narrative[2][3][7].

- **Personal Expression**: Digital gardens are spaces for personal exploration without the pressure of audience expectations. Gardeners can share their interests freely, focusing on what they find meaningful rather than adhering to niche topics[1][4].

- **Public Learning**: Many digital gardens are public, enabling others to learn from the gardener's evolving understanding. This aspect fosters community engagement and feedback, allowing for collaborative growth[3][4][6].

- **Tools and Technologies**: Digital gardeners often utilize various tools to create their spaces. Options range from no-code solutions like Notion and Obsidian to more customizable frameworks like Jekyll and Gatsby. Each tool allows for different levels of complexity and interactivity in organizing content[2][6][8].

## The Ethos of Digital Gardening

The concept of digital gardening draws inspiration from early personal websites and emphasizes a more organic approach to information sharing. It encourages imperfection and experimentation, promoting the idea that knowledge is best cultivated through ongoing reflection and iteration rather than rigid structures[3][7][8]. 

In summary, digital gardens represent a shift towards a more thoughtful, interconnected way of engaging with information online, prioritizing personal growth and community learning over traditional content creation methods.
